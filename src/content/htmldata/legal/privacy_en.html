  <h2>4) Cookies</h2>
  <p>To make the visit to our website attractive and to
    enable the use of certain functions, we use
    cookies—small text files that are stored on your device.
    Some cookies are automatically deleted after closing the
    browser (so-called “session cookies”), while others
    remain on your device and allow recognition of your
    browser on the next visit (so-called “persistent
    cookies”). The duration of storage can be found in the
    cookie settings of your browser.</p>
  <p>If personal data is also processed through individual
    cookies implemented by us, the processing is carried out

    performance of a contract, Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR in
    case of consent, or Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR to safeguard
    our legitimate interest in the best possible
    functionality of the website and a customer-friendly
    site visit.</p>
  <p>You can set your browser to notify you when cookies are
    set and decide individually on their acceptance or
    exclude the acceptance of cookies in certain cases or in
    general.</p>
  <p>Please note that the functionality of our website may
    be limited if cookies are not accepted.</p>

  </p>
  <p>The legal basis for the processing of this data is our
    legitimate interest in responding to your inquiry in

  <p>This website uses Google Analytics 4, a web analytics
    service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon
    House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland
    (“Google”), to analyze the use of our website.</p>
  <p>By default, cookies are set when visiting the website,

    also possible.</p>
  <p>Google uses this information on our behalf to evaluate
    your website use, compile reports on website activity
    for us, and provide other services related to website
    usage and internet usage. The IP address transmitted by
    your browser within the scope of Google Analytics 4 is
    not merged with other Google data. Data collected
    through Google Analytics 4 is stored for 2 months and
    then deleted.</p>
  <p>All processing mentioned above, especially the setting
    of cookies, only occurs if you have given your express
    consent in accordance with Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR. You
    can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for
    the future. To exercise your withdrawal, deactivate this
    service via the “Cookie Consent Tool” on the website.

  <p><strong>Demographic Features</strong><br>Google
    Analytics 4 uses the “demographic features” function to

    This is based on advertising and third-party
    information. These data are not personally identifiable
    and are deleted after two months.</p>

    Signals for cross-device tracking. If you have enabled
    personalized ads and linked your devices to your Google
    Account, and have consented to Google Analytics use
    (Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR), Google may analyze your
    behavior across devices. We do not receive personal
    data, only anonymized statistics. You can disable this
    under “Personalized Ads” in your Google Account. More

    TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION.
  </p>
  <p>IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL STOP PROCESSING YOUR DATA UNLESS

  <p>When processing based on consent (Art. 6 (1) lit. a

  </p>
  <p>If statutory retention periods apply (e.g., under

    expire, unless needed for contract performance or we

    is stored until you exercise your right to object under

    override your interests, or processing is required for
    legal claims.</p>
  <p>For direct marketing based on Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR,
    data is stored until you object under Art. 21 (2) GDPR.
  </p>
  <p>Unless otherwise specified, stored personal data is
    deleted when it is no longer required for its original
    purpose.</p>
