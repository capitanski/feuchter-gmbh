<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The two-piece operational suit consists of an operational jacket and operational trousers and is intended for
    officers of the Federal Police. It is worn over the Federal Police's body protection equipment.</p>

<h2>Brief Description – Operational Jacket</h2>
<ul>
    <li>With stand-up collar, concealed front zipper, four pockets</li>
    <li>Four access openings and two sleeve closures for securing body protection equipment</li>
    <li>With elastic drawcord at the hem for width adjustment</li>
    <li>With sleeve patches and police identification</li>
    <li>Operational trousers with detachable suspenders and adjustable hem construction</li>
    <li>With side, back, thigh, and lower leg pockets</li>
    <li>With inner leg zippers for securing body protection equipment</li>
</ul>

<h2>Operational Jacket and Trousers</h2>
<p>The design, wearing comfort, and fit of the jacket and trousers must be matched and functionally coordinated with
    each other.</p>

<h2>High-Quality Aramid Fabric</h2>
<p>Aramid fabric is particularly known for the following properties:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>High tensile strength</strong> – Aramid fibers are extremely resistant to tensile forces and offer high
        durability.</li>
    <li><strong>Lightweight</strong> – Despite its strength, aramid is very light.</li>
    <li><strong>Heat resistance</strong> – It withstands high temperatures and only begins to degrade at around 500 °C.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Flame-retardant</strong> – It doesn’t burn but chars when exposed to high heat.</li>
    <li><strong>Chemical resistance</strong> – Resistant to many organic solvents but sensitive to strong acids and
        bases.</li>
    <li><strong>High impact resistance</strong> – Withstands shocks and punctures, making it ideal for protective
        clothing and ballistic applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Low electrical conductivity</strong> – Used in electrical and thermal insulation applications.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Flame-Retardant Properties</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Protection against heat & flames:</strong> The material is flame-retardant and offers protection when
        exposed to fire or intense heat.</li>
    <li><strong>Integrated flame protection:</strong> The flame-retardant property is embedded in the fiber itself (not
        a chemical coating that washes out).</li>
    <li><strong>Meets safety standards:</strong> Developed for operations with increased risk potential, e.g.,
        demonstrations or large-scale events.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Membrane-Free – Breathable & Comfortable</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>High breathability:</strong> As the suit <strong>does not contain a membrane</strong>, it allows
        excellent air circulation. Ideal for physically demanding operations.</li>
    <li><strong>Quick-drying & moisture-wicking:</strong> Sweat is effectively transported outward, creating a
        comfortable wearing climate.</li>
    <li><strong>Lightweight:</strong> Without a membrane, the fabric remains lighter and more flexible than waterproof
        versions.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>High Durability & Functionality</strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Durable material:</strong> Developed for daily, demanding use in police service.</li>
    <li><strong>Ergonomic cut:</strong> Optimal freedom of movement for dynamic operations.</li>
    <li><strong>Tactical pocket layout:</strong> Multiple functional pockets for equipment like gloves, notepad,
        flashlight, or radio.</li>
    <li><strong>Reinforced seams & abrasion protection:</strong> Especially at heavily stressed areas like knees and
        elbows.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Color Scheme & Official Standards</strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Color:</strong> Dark blue – matching the uniform of general police forces.</li>
    <li><strong>Tested according to the Technical Delivery Conditions (TL) of the Federal Ministry of the
            Interior:</strong> Meets requirements for police operational clothing in Germany.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Compatibility with Protective Gear</strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Compatible with body armor & tactical equipment.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Suitable for a wide range of scenarios:</strong> Everyday duty, major events, demonstrations, traffic
        checks, etc.</li>
</ul>
